        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Data Lens is a lightweight business intelligence tool for understanding the shape and attributes of a dataset. I helped design the product that makes it possible for our customers to visualize any data, in any schema and size, and with minimal human effort, present you with a useful display of information. Data Lens enables Socrata customers to increase the quality of their published data, as well as make simple analysis of large amounts of data available to more people within the government.</p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>During my time working on this project, I transitioned from being a contributing designer to being fully responsible for the end-to-end product experience. I took part in the initial ideation phase, then co-managed the backlog of features and user stories that were developed in close collaboration with engineering. I also developed, ran, and analyzed the results of several research efforts that affected the design and direction of the product.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Data Lens was born when an older part of Socrata’s platform was no longer sufficient for the needs of our customers. In particular, our users were becoming increasingly sophisticated, and with that both their need for simple analytical tools, and the size of their datasets, grew. The old visualization experience, which was difficult to use for analytical purposes, was only performant for datasets up to a few hundred thousand rows, and we were starting to see more and more datasets that were in the millions.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>The other complaint was the fact that the default experience for any given dataset is to view it as a data grid, something that is less useful the larger the dataset. Scrolling through rows and rows of data only tells you so much about what the dataset contains in its entirety and the quality of the data therein.</p>

        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
        <p>At this point in time, Socrata did not have the mature product management organization it does today. This meant that the goals of the project were mainly driven by anecdotal stories from sales and other people in the field, as well as from the engineering organization itself.</p> 

        <p>Basically the goal was defined as designing a product that does the following:
          <ul>
            <li class="list">Makes it easier to get a sense of what a multi million row dataset actually contains</li>
            <li class="list">Gives you an idea of the quality and consistency of the dataset contents</li>
            <li class="list">Minimizes the amount of human skill and effort needed to do the above</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>The first iteration of this product came together quickly considering its scope. We designed and developed the first version, that we released as a beta during our yearly customer conference, in less than 6 months. During that time I:
          <ul>
            <li class="list">Was part of coming up with the overall design solution that shipped to customers</li>
            <li class="list">Co-managed the backlog of features in collaboration with product management</li>
            <li class="list">Lead a usability test with more than 20 customers that resulted in several usability improvements</li>
            <li class="list">Designed and analyzed the results of a ~100 person survey that directed the visual design of the product</li>
            <li class="list">Wrote detailed acceptance criteria for every feature, which saved developers and testers time by reducing ambiguity up front</li>
            <li class="list">Lead a cross-organizational bug-bash to find and document issues before the public release</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>This is one of the the most complex product development projects I’ve ever worked on, and I was thankful that I have at least an academic background in software engineering. As we were designing we had continuous discussions and negotiations with senior engineers and architects. Being able to speak the same language around any technical constraints and opportunities made it easier for us to design and deliver system that would accommodate datasets of any size in a performant way.</p>

        <p>The other challenging part of this project was the breadth of data that needed to be supported. Typically, if you are designing a data visualization experience, like an infographic or a dashboard, you know the subject of the data, and probably even the exact set of attributes and types found in the data. Not so for Data Lens, here we had to accommodate any data possible, not matter shape and size. Our approach here was to go through hundreds of the datasets our customers had already uploaded, and analyze the schema of each one. To do this we used a prototype that my colleague had written that took in real data, and after categorizing the columns, it would render an interactive experience similar to the one we were aiming for.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>We ended up shipping a product that made it really easy to gain basic insights. The strengths of Data Lens lay in the fact that you never have to start from scratch, and the low technical bar needed to perform advanced roll ups and filters. The interface always suggests a few visualizations as a starting point, and data is automatically rolled up. Filtering is as simple as clicking any part of a visualization and it will filter the entire page. With a little bit more effort of customizing your page, you can end up with a tailored information experience that makes it easy to answer basic questions.</p>

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>In general, our customers’ initial responses to the product were positive:</p>
        <div class="customer-quotes">
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <span class="quote">“"For basic analysis this is a big improvement"</span> 
            <span class="caption">- Survey respondent</span>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <span class="quote">"I have much less reason to look at the table, which I feel pretty good about"</span>
            <span class="caption">- Customer</span>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <span class="quote">"Overall it's a really nice and clean interface. I'm impressed."</span> 
            <span class="caption">- Usability Participant</span>
          </div>
        </div><!-- /.customer-quotes -->

        <p>Over time however, adoption of the new tool did not take off as anticipated. There were a few reasons for this:
          <ul>
            <li class="list">We didn’t add functionality fast enough to reach parity with our old visualization library and query functionality, so the motivation to move to something that had fewer capabilities was a hard sell</li>
            <li class="list">The page looked nothing like the rest of the site, and couldn’t match the branding requirements of our customers -- even the ability to customize the colors of the charts wasn’t yet available</li>
            <li class="list">Data Lens worked the absolute best with a certain set of data schemas. Customers that kept their data in unusual schemas struggled to adopt the tool</li>
            <li class="list">Data Lens did not work well on mobile</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Iterations & Future Design</h3>
        <p>Motivated to solve the issues that were hindering the adoption of the product, I eventually became the lead designer for Data Lens and kicked off several projects to address the problems mentioned above.</p>

        <p>My approach to the fact that the page didn’t visually fit with the rest of the product was aided by a [styleguide project|link…] started by myself and another designer. Using the new guidelines it was easier to put together a vision that aligned better with the overall look and feel of the Socrata platform.</p>

        <span class="caption">My vision for what Data Lens could look like</span>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>I also put together a plan for how to make Data Lens work better on mobile. We had opted to de-prioritize this work in the first version due to time and resource constraints. One of my many learnings of this project is that unless you build a mobile responsive product from the start, you’ll have a really hard time finding the time to go back and do it later.</p>

        <p>These changes together with continued effort of expanding on the visualizations to make them as feature rich and customizable as Socrata’s legacy dataset visualization toolset would be the first steps to increased adoption.</p>

        <h3>Sometimes, things don't go as planned</h3>
        <p>At some point in time, looking at the usage data and the requests from customers that were still trickling in, we (product management, product design, engineering management) came to the conclusion that in order to make the changes we deemed necessary to get adoption to a place we were happy with, we would need to re-architect a rather large portion of the code-base. After carefully planning and laying out the transition between the current and the re-architected product, I was pulled off to go lead the efforts of a different area of the product that struggled with a really high value problem that had been prevalent for years. After I left the team, the re-architecture was unfortunately put on hold in favor of things with potentially higher ROI. While it was disappointing that most of my work never made it to production, I personally found it a valuable exercise in both visual design and project planning.</p>
